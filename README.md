# MATLAB Optical System Simulations  

This repository contains MATLAB implementations for analyzing and simulating key aspects of optical communication systems. The focus is on apodization functions, BER (Bit Error Rate) evaluation, reflectivity modeling, spectrum analysis, and comparative performance studies.  

## Features  
- **Apodization Functions** – Apply different windowing techniques to improve spectral characteristics.  
- **BER Analysis** – Evaluate bit error rate under various system conditions.  
- **Reflectivity Modeling** – Simulate reflectivity effects in optical devices.  
- **Spectrum Analysis** – Study the spectral response of optical signals.  
- **Comparative Studies** – Compare system performance across different configurations.  

## Requirements  
- MATLAB R2021a or later (earlier versions may also work).  
- Signal Processing Toolbox (for certain apodization and spectrum functions).  

## Usage  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/MATLAB-Optical-Apodization-BER-Analysis.git
